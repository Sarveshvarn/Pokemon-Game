# Pokemon-Game

This Game is a combination of
1. Map Creation: - this is done using the Tiled Map Editor
            link: - https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled
2. Javascript: - Multiple js files are created separating the data files and the functional files in 2 folders
Why? 
To make the code cleaner and visible for the readers
3. HTML & CSS: - this is minimal in amount as compared to Javascript and Tiled

Note: - The Pellet Town.png and the foregroundObjects.png are created using Tiled
